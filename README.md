# Arduino Googles [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SConaway/arduino-googles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SConaway/arduino-googles)

This is the code for a set of googles, originally based off an Adafruit Trinket 5V.

I'm programming it at 3V, 8MHz, because it seems to have problems maintaining a high enough voltage from the battery pack (2 CR20302)
